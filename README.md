  <h3> Personal Details of Dr. Norman Borlaug </h3> 
  </ul>
  <li> In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for a lifetime of work to feed a hungry world. </li>
  <li> Although a scientist with outstanding contributions, perhaps Dr. Borlaug's greatest achievement has been his unending struggle to integrate the various streams of agricultural research into viable technologies and to convince political leaders to bring these advances to fruition. </li>
  <li>Born of Norwegian descent, Dr. Borlaug was raised in Cresco, a small farming community in northeast Iowa. </li>
  <li> These new wheat varieties and improved crop management practices transformed agricultural production in Mexico during the 1940's and 1950's and later in Asia and Latin America, sparking what today is known as the "Green Revolution." Because of his achievements to prevent hunger, famine and misery around the world, it is said that Dr. Borlaug has "saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived."</li>
